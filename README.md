# granular-deployment

One of the problems in the development and maintenance of
systems with a microservice architecture is the laboriousness of the
process of updating application programming interfaces (API) while
maintaining backward compatibility and constant system availability.
The paper proposes a solution to the problem - a method of automated
deployment and management of a group of services by using the
capabilities of infrastructure mechanisms such as orchestration and
service mesh.

The proposed method was implemented in the form of an
integration library and a Kubernetes service that manages the
deployment and routing processes. The obtained test results show a
significant increase in the automation of an API update process.
